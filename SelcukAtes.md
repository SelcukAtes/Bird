### EXPERIENCE

#### Xtress ​​|| ​​ ​​Software Engineer 2018-Present

* Engineered Node/Express tool for developers to track server load and identify bottlenecks in their apps by simulating concurrent user activity to test individual routes/middleware stacks and ensure scalability
* Leveraged Node.js Performance API hooks to analyze middleware function and run time, allowing an engineer to meticulously view all relevant analytical data within an interactive GUI
* Wrote CLI scripts to auto-generate a React application and creating custom parsing algorithms to flatten deeply nested data structures into collapsible tree layouts to render dynamic animations using D
* Implemented Redux for improved state management of the application reducing unnecessary passing of props and preserving instances of state allowing for a more streamlined debugging process
* Used Node.js Performance API metrics to create functions that check middleware HTTP routes individually by analyzing speed and scalability using massive amounts of concurrent requests to determine where the breaks points are
* Implemented D3 DOM to render structured and collapsible trees allowing user to understand the routing more intuitively and visual represent stress-test data through a mapped graphical interface that receives live updates from the proxy server
* Designed Material UI template components to deliver consistent comparisons among individual routes and their monitored performance metrics through modified trees structures representing the application's component hierarchy
